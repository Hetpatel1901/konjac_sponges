        <h3>Our founders</h3>

        <p>Michele Riley has a background in natural products, having started out in natural baby and child products. You will sometimes find details of Konjac Sponges that have come along since ours having "started out as baby sponges", and thats correct, as Michele launched the products for this purpose, but quickly discovered the benefits for all age categories and worked to have other ingredients with skincare benefits added. She has never looked back.</p>
